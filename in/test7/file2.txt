Nazz Van Bartonschmeer is the unattainable love interest in the show. Trendy and beautiful, she mostly hangs out with Kevin. All of the boys except Rolf and Jimmy are infatuated with her. Whenever one of the boys encounters her, they often begin to sweat and lose the ability to speak coherently. She is the head cheerleader at Peach Creek Jr. High.

Although Nazz is usually depicted as sweet and smart, she can occasionally be somewhat eccentric and acts as the stereotypical "dumb blonde" and girl-next-door. She doesn't mind the Eds unless they bother her or her friends.
